# MovieRecommender
The reccomenderAPI has all of the methods for the command line. this class consists of the add users, remove user etc. 
This also has the top 10 movies. There is a serializer class there with the code but dont know if it works because i never checked it.

The top 10 movies gets the average for all of the ratings and then will sort the movies array based on the average ratings.

I was unbale to creat a recommendator because i ran out of time. also the same with the testers.
